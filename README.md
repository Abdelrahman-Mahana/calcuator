# calcuator
The code creates a calculator class that inherits from the tkinter Frame class. The class has an init method which sets up the GUI of the calculator. It creates an Entry widget to display the input and output, a "clear" button to clear the display, and several buttons for the digits and mathematical operators. The "evaluate" function is defined to evaluate the mathematical expression entered by the user. The calculator class is then instantiated and the mainloop method is called to start the event loop. The resulting calculator will look like a basic calculator where you can enter mathematical expressions and it will evaluate the expression and display the result.
